## Description:
 We are effectively developing a frontend, open source food recipe web application. All of the content and information used is fetched from a free open, crowd-sourced database API called the MealDB, which contains hundreds of unique and culturally influenced recipes from around the world. It is meant to be a resourceful experience for all skill levels of cooking enthusiasts and food lovers. As a user, you should be able to navigate all of the available recipe information with user-friendly interactivity.
## Make Sure You Run  json-server --watch db.json!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
## Also if you have a large moniter use the higherRes.css, but if not use the food.css, jsut change which one in Html.
## FEATURES
1. DropDown menu to display all the filters and an option to load one random meal.
2. Search forms to look up all Meals that are filtered by Catagory, Ingredients, and Area
3. A main Search form that can look up any recipie containing that value, as well as hit Search and display all!
4. Top ten meals button, that will display 10 random meals!
5. Latest Meals btn that will display the latest meals to be added to the server.
6. Create Your own Recipie button that will open a form that you can create your own.
7. The newly created meal will persist and be stored on db.json and persist!
8. Display all of your own created recipies, or Recipies added by another user.

## GETTING STARTED WITH THE PROJECT 
1. This project uses a Api Key which is hidden. If you want this to work you will need to change the script in
Html from apiKey.js to load freeKey.js. You will not have access to all the filters or top ten but you will be 
able to do most of the features.
2. So depending on your resolution you will either refer to food.css(if you are using a laptop) or you will use
higherRes.css if you ahvea high resolution Moniter.
