INTRODUCTION

Title: Ultimate Recipe Finder

Collaborators: Ashley King, Joshua Collins, Derrick Cleavall

Description: We are effectively developing a frontend, open source food recipe web application. All of the content and information used is fetched from a free open, crowd-sourced database API called the MealDB, which contains hundreds of unique and culturally influenced recipes from around the world. It is meant to be a resourceful experience for all skill levels of cooking enthusiasts and food lovers. As a user, you should be able to navigate all of the available recipe information with user-friendly interactivity.
Make Sure You Run  json-server --watch db.json!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

2. Search forms to look up all Meals that are filtered by Catagory, Ingredients, and Area
